Problem Statement:
The project aims to analyze the distribution and diversity of bird species in two distinct ecosystems: forests and grasslands. By examining bird species observations across these habitats, the goal is to understand how environmental factors, such as vegetation type, climate, and terrain, influence bird populations and their behavior. The study will involve working on the provided observational data of bird species present in both ecosystems, identifying patterns of habitat preference, and assessing the impact of these habitats on bird diversity. The findings can provide valuable insights into habitat conservation, biodiversity management, and the effects of environmental changes on avian communities.

Business Use Cases:
Wildlife Conservation: Inform decisions on protecting critical bird habitats and enhancing biodiversity conservation efforts.
Land Management: Optimize land use and habitat restoration strategies by understanding the preferences of different bird species.
Eco-Tourism: Identify bird-rich areas to develop bird-watching tourism, attracting eco-tourists and boosting local economies.
Sustainable Agriculture: Support the development of agricultural practices that minimize the impact on bird populations in grasslands and forests.
Policy Support: Provide data-driven insights to help environmental agencies create effective conservation policies and strategies for vulnerable bird species.
Biodiversity Monitoring: Track the health and diversity of avian populations, aiding in the monitoring of ecosystem stability.

Approach:
 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing data and standardize observational metrics.
Filter relevant columns for analysis (e.g., species, environmental factors, temporal data).
Consolidate data from forest and grassland units into comparable formats.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the distribution of species across administrative units and habitat types.
Study observation frequency by year, month, and season.
Investigate relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) and bird activity.
Types of Analysis- Examples:
Temporal Analysis
Seasonal Trends: Analyze the Date and Year columns to detect patterns in bird sightings across different seasons or years.
Observation Time: Study the Start_Time and End_Time to determine if specific time windows correlate with higher bird activity.

Spatial Analysis
Location Insights: Group data by Location_Type (e.g., Grassland) to identify biodiversity hotspots.
Plot-Level Analysis: Compare observations across different Plot_Name to see which plots attract more species or specific kinds of birds.


3. Species Analysis
Diversity Metrics: Count unique species (Scientific_Name) observed and their distribution across Location_Type.
Activity Patterns: Check the Interval_Length and ID_Method columns to identify the most common activity types (e.g., Singing).
Sex Ratio: Analyze the Sex column to understand the male-to-female ratio for different species.

4. Environmental Conditions
Weather Correlation: Explore how Temperature, Humidity, Sky, and Wind impact observations, such as the number of birds or their distances.
Disturbance Effect: Assess the impact of Disturbance (e.g., slight effect) on bird sightings.

5. Distance and Behavior
Distance Analysis: Evaluate the Distance column to identify species typically observed closer or farther from the observer.
Flyover Frequency: Examine the Flyover_Observed column to detect trends in bird behavior during observation.

6. Observer Trends
Observer Bias: Analyze data by Observer to check if specific individuals report more observations or certain species.
Visit Patterns: Evaluate the Visit column to see how repeated visits affect species count or diversity.

7. Conservation Insights
Watchlist Trends: Use the PIF_Watchlist_Status and Regional_Stewardship_Status to identify trends in species that are at risk or require conservation focus.
AOU Code Patterns: Study the distribution of species based on their AOU_Code to correlate with regional or national conservation priorities.
3. Visualization
Create interactive visualizations using Plotly in Streamlit or Power BI.
Dynamic scatter plots and bar charts for species distributions.
Temporal heatmaps for year-wise and month-wise observations.
Geographic mapping (if location data is available) to highlight high-activity zones.
Explore specific species or environmental conditions.
4. Other Insights
Identify high-activity regions and seasons for specific bird species.
Uncover the influence of environmental factors on species behavior and activity.
Highlight at-risk species and conservation priorities for targeted efforts.
Expected Results:

Derive insights into bird species' temporal and spatial distribution across forest and grassland habitats.

Data Set Explanation:
The dataset contains observational data for bird species recorded across multiple forest sites. It includes detailed columns describing location, observation methods, bird species, and environmental conditions.
Admin_Unit_Code: The code for the administrative unit (e.g., "ANTI") where the observation was conducted.
Sub_Unit_Code: The sub-unit within the administrative unit for further classification.
Site_Name: The name of the specific observation site within the unit.
Plot_Name: A unique identifier for the specific plot where observations were recorded.
Location_Type: The habitat type of the observation area (e.g., "Forest").
Year: The year in which the observation took place.
Date: The exact date of the observation.
Start_Time: The start time of the observation session.
End_Time: The end time of the observation session.
Observer: The individual who conducted the observation.
Visit: The count of visits made to the same observation site or plot.
Interval_Length: The duration of the observation interval (e.g., "0-2.5 min").
ID_Method: The method used to identify the species (e.g., "Singing," "Calling," "Visualization").
Distance: The distance of the observed species from the observer (e.g., "<= 50 Meters").
